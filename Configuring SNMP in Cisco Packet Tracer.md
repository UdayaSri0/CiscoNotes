## Introduction

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a standard protocol designed for managing and monitoring devices on a network. It enables network administrators to collect data from devices (agents), configure them remotely, and receive notifications about network events. SNMP operates on a manager-agent model, where the manager queries or controls agents using community strings for authentication.

This guide provides a **comprehensive yet practical** SNMP configuration for Cisco IOS devices in Packet Tracer. We’ll focus on **read-only (RO)** access for monitoring—ideal for most use cases—while including optional **read/write (RW)** configuration for lab scenarios requiring remote changes. By the end, you’ll be able to configure SNMP, verify it, and troubleshoot issues effectively.

> [!tip]+ Why Start with RO?  
> In production, **read-only** SNMP minimizes security risks by preventing unauthorized changes. Reserve **RW** for controlled environments like labs or automation with strict access controls.

## 1. Prerequisites 🔧

Before configuring SNMP, ensure the following:

- **Software**: Cisco Packet Tracer installed on your computer.
- **Knowledge**: Basic understanding of networking concepts (IP addressing, subnets) and Cisco IOS commands.
- **Topology**: A simple network in Packet Tracer with:
    - **Device (Agent)**: A Cisco IOS router or multilayer switch (e.g., `Router0`).
    - **Manager**: A PC configured as an SNMP manager (e.g., IP `192.168.1.10/24`).
    - **Connectivity**: Layer 3 reachability between the router (`192.168.1.1/24`) and the PC (`ping 192.168.1.10` from the router).

> [!note]  
> Verify IP configuration and routing (e.g., `show ip interface brief`, `ping`) before proceeding.

## 2. Configuration Cheat-sheet 📄

### 2.1 Enable SNMP and Define Read-Only (RO) Community 🕵️‍♂️

Enable SNMP on the router and set a read-only community string for monitoring.

```plaintext
enable
configure terminal
snmp-server community MyR0Public RO
```

- `MyR0Public`: A user-defined community string (case-sensitive, sent in plain text in SNMP v1/v2c).
- `RO`: Restricts access to read-only operations (e.g., GET, GETNEXT).

#### Optional: Restrict Access to the Manager’s IP

Enhance security by limiting SNMP access to the manager’s IP using an access list.

```plaintext
ip access-list standard SNMP-MANAGERS
 permit 192.168.1.10
exit
snmp-server community MyR0Public RO SNMP-MANAGERS
```

- `SNMP-MANAGERS`: A standard ACL allowing only `192.168.1.10` to poll the router.
- Associates the ACL with the RO community string.

---

### 2.2 Optional: Add Read/Write (RW) Community ✍️

For lab scenarios requiring configuration changes via SNMP, define an RW community string.

```plaintext
snmp-server community MyR0Private RW SNMP-MANAGERS
```

- `MyR0Private`: RW community string.
- `SNMP-MANAGERS`: Applies the same ACL for consistency and security.

> [!warning]  
> Use RW cautiously—only in secure, controlled environments (e.g., labs). In production, avoid RW unless protected by VPNs, AAA, or SNMP v3.

---

### 2.3 House-keeping Info 🏷️

Add optional device metadata for inventory management.

```plaintext
snmp-server location "Kandy HQ – MDF"
snmp-server contact "UdayaSri, NetOps, +94 712 345 678"
```

- `snmp-server location`: Specifies the device’s physical location (populates `sysLocation` OID).
- `snmp-server contact`: Provides admin contact details (populates `sysContact` OID).

---

### 2.4 Configure Traps (Optional) 📨

Enable the router to send unsolicited notifications (traps) to the manager about events like interface changes.

```plaintext
snmp-server host 192.168.1.10 version 2c MyR0Public
snmp-server enable traps snmp linkdown linkup
```

- `snmp-server host`: Configures the trap receiver (`192.168.1.10`), using SNMP v2c and the RO community string.
- `snmp-server enable traps`: Enables specific traps (`linkdown`, `linkup`) rather than all events for efficiency.

> [!tip]  
> Use `version 2c` in Packet Tracer as it supports more features than v1 and is widely compatible.

---

## 3. Verification 🧪

Confirm the SNMP configuration works as expected.

### On the Router (Agent)

Use these Cisco IOS commands:

```plaintext
show snmp                ! Displays SNMP status and statistics
show snmp community      ! Lists community strings and associated ACLs
show snmp host           ! Verifies trap receiver configuration
debug snmp packets       ! Monitors real-time SNMP traffic (use `undebug all` to stop)
```

### On the PC (Manager)

Use Packet Tracer’s **SNMP Manager** tool:

1. Open the PC, go to **Desktop** > **SNMP Manager**.
2. Configure the tool:
    - **Remote SNMP Agent**: `192.168.1.1` (router’s IP).
    - **Community**: `MyR0Public` (RO string).
    - **SNMP Version**: `v2c`.
3. Click **Poll** to retrieve data (e.g., `sysName`, interface stats).
4. Test traps:
    - On the router: `interface FastEthernet0/0`, `shutdown`.
    - Check the **Trap Log** in the SNMP Manager for a `linkdown` event.

## 4. Troubleshooting ⛑️

Resolve common SNMP issues with this table:

|Symptom|Likely Cause|Fix|
|---|---|---|
|Timeout / No response|Wrong community string or ACL mismatch|Verify string (`show snmp community`), check ACL (`show access-lists`).|
|“Bad community name”|RW string used but only RO defined|Ensure correct string; add RW if needed.|
|Trap log empty|Traps not enabled or wrong IP|Confirm `snmp-server host` and `enable traps`.|
|Unreachable|IP/gateway/subnet mismatch|Test connectivity (`ping`), check `show ip int br`.|

> [!note]  
> Always start troubleshooting with basic connectivity (`ping`) before diving into SNMP-specific issues.

## 5. Next Steps 🚀

Take your SNMP skills further:

1. **Scale Up**: Configure SNMP on multiple devices and poll them from a central manager.
2. **Explore MIBs**: Use Packet Tracer’s **OID Browser** to inspect Management Information Base (MIB) objects (e.g., `ifDescr`, `sysUpTime`).
3. **SNMP v3**: Transition to SNMP v3 for authentication and encryption. Note: Packet Tracer has limited v3 support—use GNS3 or physical devices for full functionality.

> [!info]  
> SNMP v1 and v2c transmit community strings in plain text, posing a security risk. SNMP v3 offers authentication and encryption but isn’t fully supported in Packet Tracer.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You’ve configured SNMP on a Cisco device in Packet Tracer, enabling monitoring and optional remote management. You can now retrieve device data, receive event notifications, and troubleshoot effectively. Prioritize security by sticking to RO access and restricting manager IPs in real-world scenarios.

**Happy Monitoring!** 🎉
